Homework 6


Alright well this was challenging, yet again. Even though we were given the tools in our exercise, I still struggle to keep up and to understand syntax.

Par the course, this is a video game- gif generator and the buttons a user presses will generated gifs of whatever was clicked. To append/ add gifs, it's not perfect and does not add what the user would want to most likely. 

If anything, it should be aesthetically pleasing.

(At a later date, I'll like change my viewer into a locked-scroll rather than having the entirety having to be scrolled down.)
